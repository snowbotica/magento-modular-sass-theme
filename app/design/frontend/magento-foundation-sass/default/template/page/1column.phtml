	    		<h3>Rather than focus on providing the website owner with a bewildering array of customisation options at the expense of confusing bloated code, our aim is to provide solid, easy to understand and highly customisable code. </h3> 
                <p>We also believe software should be open source at the point of purchase so all of our themes and extensions are available for your perusal on github.</p> 
                <p>It's all too easy to spend time and money gathering a purchase order for an extension only to find that it's sloppily written or simply not compatable to integrate with other aspects of your site or theme. We hope that rather than lose sales by making our source code freely available that our approach will reduce the barrier of entry for professional purchases. For hobbiest, beginner or simply flat broke developers we also offer low cost instruction manuals for each of our products.</p>
